A page within an AMP story is represented by the `<amp-story-page>` component. Within an [`amp-story`](../../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-story.md), you can have one or more `<amp-story-page>` components, containing each of the individual screens of a story. The first page you specify in the document order is the first page that displays in the story.
